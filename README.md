- Before and after removing the potentially academically dishonest scores from Thomas High School, we see that they rank 2nd in "% Overall Passing" regardless. It appears that removing the grade 9 scores had a negligable impact on their schools overall performance.

### How replacing the ninth-grade scores affected various outputs:
- Math and reading scores by grade:
Of course, our ninth grade scores were replaced with "NaN"s, so there are no values anymore for Thomas High School grade 9 math and reading scores.

- Scores by school spending:
This had no affect on school spending.

- Scores by school size:
Again, the overall affects were negligable

- Scores by school type:
Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
